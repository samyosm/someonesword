# Someone's Word

Someone's Word is an app where you can put some words in a pool of words, then people can fetch from it to get random words from anyone who has participated in filling it.

## Objectif

My objectif was to complete an application in as little time as possible. This I hoped would practice my deadline-respecting skill. I believe to have succeded my goal for I finished the planning, the designing, the coding, and the hosting in less than 10 hours.  

## Completion

This project uses another one of my projects (https://github.com/samyosm/lab/tree/main/RandomMessage/BackEnd). That previous API allowed me to store some messages in a pool and to retrieve them. For the design, I simply used Figma and another amazing website I discovered for getting some nice color palette (https://huemint.com/website-1/).

## Attestation

If you would like to try the website, it is online right now at (samyos.live)[http://samyos.live/someonesword], but I might change it to a subdomain later.
